#Document-scanner

Building a document scanner with OpenCV can be accomplished in just 
three simple steps:

Step 1: Detect edges.

Step 2: Use the edges in the image to find the contour (outline) representing the piece of paper being scanned.

Step 3: Apply a perspective transform to obtain the top-down view of the document.
